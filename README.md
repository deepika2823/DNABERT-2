1. **DNABERT-2**, an efficient foundation model, aids in virus detection by processing genomic sequences.
2. It replaces k-mer tokenization with **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**, enhancing efficiency.
3. By analyzing DNA sequences, DNABERT-2 can identify patterns associated with specific viruses.
4. Researchers leverage DNABERT-2 to classify pathogens, including COVID-19, based on their genomic information.
